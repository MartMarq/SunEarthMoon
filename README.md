Watchface for Watchy (SQFMI)

no wifi, no bluetooth but long battery life

there is a time adjustment routine in Uhr.cpp

every day at 0:30 it sets back time by 15 seconds and 500 ms, because my Watchy runs too fast. Just delete it (or set another adjustment)

The earth is in the position of the hour hand.
The moon is in the position of a minute hand, but the earth is the center of the moon!
The comet indicates the battery (3 comet tails = full, no comet tail = nearly empty)

The position of the stars in the background are random. Number of the stars: every 50 steps adds on star (which could be covered by the sun, the earth or the moon).

Both watchfaces show the same time.
